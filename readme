# Glove Finder (Streamlit)

A simple, iOS-friendly Streamlit app to filter and find gloves by EN388 rating, cut level/category, colour and safety attributes (food, chemical, heat). Results include a link to the product page, the glove image (if available), the name and a compact list of attributes.

## Running locally

1. Ensure the Excel file `wurth_safety_glove_MASTER List.xlsx` is in the repo root.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Notes
- The app expects the following columns in the Excel: `Glove Name, Article Numbers, Colour, Image, EN 388 Code, Abrasion, Cut, Tear, Puncture, Cut Category, Impact, Chemical Resistance, Heat Resistance, Food Safe, Tactile, Product Link`.
- Image display: the app will show an image if the `Image` column contains a valid URL or a local image file path. If your images are embedded in Excel rather than in cells, please export them to files and add a new column with their file paths or URLs.
- Booleans such as `Food Safe`, `Chemical Resistance`, and `Heat Resistance` accept values like `Yes/No`, `Y/N`, `True/False`.

## Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)
- Push this folder to GitHub.
- On Streamlit Cloud, create a new app pointing to `app.py`. Set the working directory to the repo root and include `requirements.txt`.

## Customisation
- To add more filters, extend the filter section in `app.py` and ensure the column exists in Excel.
- For brand styling, adjust `st.set_page_config` and add custom CSS via `st.markdown('<style>...</style>', unsafe_allow_html=True)` if required.
